This was a problem I encountered when doing the Google Foobar challenge (Level 1). The basis of this problem
is that we have a cake with its edges lined with M&Ms of different colors. Each letter of the alphabet (a-z)
represents a uniquely colored M&M. We have to cut slices of the cake so that everyone gets the same colored
sequence of M&Ms, with no leftover slices of the cake. Also, we want to serve as many people as possible,
so we want to maximize the number of slices we cut.
